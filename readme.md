## Evaluations on PVR

This is my (unofficial) implementation and evaluation on 

> Chiyuan Zhang, Maithra Raghu, Jon Kleinberg, Samy Bengio(2021). Pointer Value Retrieval: A new benchmark for understanding the limits of neural network generalization, [Paper in arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.12580).

Please refer to [Notes on Pointer Value Retrieval](https://www.zhihu.com/column/graph-neural-networks) for a detailed description of the files and discussions of open problems in the paper. For visual PVR, you need first generate dataset with vis_dataset_generation.ipynb.

More code and report in English will come soon. You may contact me at qiuqiu1602@gmail.com
